## Overview
Starbucks is an international coffee shop chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington, USA. Established in 1971, Starbucks is now one of the world's renowned brands in the F&B industry.

The target customer groups for Starbucks are diverse, including students, professionals, and even those who enjoy a comfortable space for relaxation and work. Due to this, Starbucks not only focuses on selling beverages and food items but also builds a business model centered around customer experiences.

Around 2018, Starbucks, in collaboration with [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/blog/2018/05/introducing-udacity-data-scientist-nanodegree-program.html), released a dataset containing campaign data and anonymized customer information to support research projects at universities worldwide. The dataset includes 76,277 marketing offers sent to 17,000 users over 30 days.

In this project, we will delve into the **analysis and provide suggestions for business and advertising strategies** based on Starbucks customer behavior and their interactions with offers.
